# Tabletop-helper
a really simple app that roll different dices and toss a coin 

i made it as a workaround for times when i dont have access to my dices and coins since i travel a lot and im one of those guys who has his labtop at all time
it uses CustomTkinter instead of Tkinter to look better and right now it supports Coin and d4,d6,d8,d12,d20,d100 dices
might add more futures later
